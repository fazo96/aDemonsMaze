# Experiment
Just experimenting with [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io). I will probably turn
this into a small game.

## Try
Go to [GitHub Pages](http://fazo96.github.io/rogue) to play the `stable` branch
(which is *extremely* outdated at the moment) or clone the `dev` branch, compile,
open `index.html` in a web browser, and play!

## Compile
Just build the `game.coffee` file into `game.js`
